# Automated_BlackJack_Dealing_Robotic_Manipulator
Used robotics principles to design a 6-dof RRR manipulator that can be mounted to a casino table and facilitate Blackjack gameplay. Implemented MATLAB functions to compute kinematics, path planning, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic equations of motion for the manipulator. Implemented a MIMO control system in Simulink that accounted for dynamic nonlinearities in the manipulator.
